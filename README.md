## Story

The premise of the story is about a boy who loses his shoes.
These shoes are ordinary, but for this boy they mean everything, because
his mother gave them as a gift, just before she passed away, making him an orphan.

The boy is around 12 and he lives in the streets. He sleeps where he can
and finds food how ever, usually by stealing. One day after being chased out of his sleeping location
he realizes that he forgot his sandals. Going back the cart that he slept in is gone, and the owner
nowhere to be seen.

This starts his journey of finding his prized sandals. On this journey he meets a man, and
in the course of things his sandals are hardly that important any more. This man loves
him, when he shouldn't.
